## LLD (OOD)- Low Level Design
LLD talks about the class diagrams with the methods and relations 
between classes, program specs and other low level details for a given
system. It is also known as Object Oriented Design (OOD). Design patterns are
programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem.

Beautiful LLD design includes:-
1. Modular
2. Flexible
3. maintainable 
4. reusable software

Example:
1. design a parking lot
2. design a chess game
3. design a tic toe toc game


## Object oriented principles:
* SOLID:

1. Requirement clarification
2. Design core classes and objects
3. Establish relationship between core classes and objects.
